# Project Todos

The purpose of this project was to create a todo app using redux and a global state.

## The problem

I started with the App.js file and a tasks.js reducer file and set up my store. I moved on to create the components I needed.
An input form for the user to write and publish new tasks, a list for the tasks and a header and footer. 
Then I created my different actions, add task, remove task, change between completed/not completed and a remove all action.
